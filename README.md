# Vandest Shiny Stock Parts

### Descrition:
VSSP is a set of settings for Textures Unlimited mod, made by texturing. Why by texturing? Because in most cases we need this method to get further details.ï»¿
With this method we can use diferent settings in a single mesh, that we can't do with a text settings.
A file with text settings already exit for stock parts, it was made by Electrocutor  and it can be found in [Electrocutor's Thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/168795-electrocutors-thread/).
My setting can be use alongside of this "Original Stock TU Patch" from Electrocutor. It's even recommended, cause my VSSP is not yet complete. (WIP ...)
It will recommended even ultimately, because some parts don't need to be set with further details. (like structural parts fully metal with a single color)
